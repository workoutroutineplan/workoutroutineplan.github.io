<p>I avoid all preworkouts and supplements when breastfeeding. I am currently breastfeeding my 19 month old twins and for a pre workout I tend to drink ice coffee or something but I dont like that I usually have to urinate during my workout so I was thinking of alternatives. Nurse your baby just before exercising to avoid the uncomfortable feeling of engorgement or fullness during your workout. I used pre workout before my pregnancy and honestly find black coffee just as effective when breastfeeding. It is a little weakunderdosed but is a pretty good price point around 20.</p>
