<p>Generally you can expect that your pre workout will take 30 minutes to kick in and energize you for 15 to 25 hours considering you are a healthy adult and your body is able to fully. This feeling which can last for about 30 minutes to 90 minutes is a common effect of taking beta-alanine containing pre-workout supplement. To top that off I cant train until 2000 and when the time comes Im always tired. The life of pre-workout ingredients can last from less than an hour to over 6 hours. How long pre-workout last will depend on the specific ingredients in your supplement but generally its effects will last anywhere from two to three hours Mobin says.</p>

<p>Given the varying half-lives of caffeine and arginine the effects of a pre-workout will last anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. You might be wondering how long does pre workout last. This will vary based on your age and rate of metabolism as well as the type of supplement taken. If youre still feeling it more than three hours later you could try taking a smaller dose next time. Caffeine for instance affects the body for up to 5 hours while beta-alanine and L-carnitine last for only up to an hour.</p>
