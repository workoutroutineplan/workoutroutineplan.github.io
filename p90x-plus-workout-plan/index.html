<p>Ritesh Rana - favorite favorite. Now for where the two routines differ. I suggested to her that for every workout session that I did 30 minutes of cardio or 1 P90x video I would earn 1 minute of topless time on our trip. But while theres some exercise and rep variety from week to week some would call V Shred. V Shreds HIIT core and upperlower-body workouts can absolutely help you drop a few pounds and build lean mass. She wanted me to start working out more to improve my health but I simply could not be bothered mostly because of the huge time commitment plus the fact that I really dont like working out.</p>
