I have many prisoner fitness books and think this has the most physically demanding workouts without questions. The tough repetitive body weight workouts are exactly what the book promotes along with a no nonsense diet plan. With jacked inmates as your motivation certified trainer Teufel and counselor Kroger have locked down an exercise regimen thats guaranteed to show real results. Its the workout of a lifetimefrom guys serving twenty-five to life.</p>

<p>Download it once and read it on your Kindle device PC phones or tablets. The workouts can be tailored so that they match any level of fitness and everyone can participate in a positive energy-charged atmosphere. As far a FELON FITNESS goes I like it I think the men in the pictures were ex cons. This facility is full of music energy and inspiring workouts. Youll perform the squats immediately followed by the push-ups.</p>
