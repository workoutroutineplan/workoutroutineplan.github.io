<p>The answer is definitely not. Diarrhea after consuming a pre-workout can be a reaction to some of the ingredients. The manufacturers instructions sometimes mention the use of a small volume of water. I dont generally get diarrhea but most preworkouts make me have to have a preworkout bm pretty normal just like a cup of coffee keeps many people regular. After taking a pre-workout supplement you might suffer from diarrhea.</p>
