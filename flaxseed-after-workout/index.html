<p>I added chia seeds and kept it simple with frozen bananas almond milk green protein and milled flaxseed. Most bodybuilders add flaxseed to their post-workout drinks by blending it with protein powders and some fruits. Reduces the side effects of anabolic steroids and helps in the excretion of estrogen. I wasnt able to find a study that compared body response to protein source post workout specifically. To summarize if you eat the flax seed you may not get as much protein as you would from a meat source but it may have other benefits that the meat wouldnt especially if you already do consume animal proteins at other time.</p>

<p>If I dont have a full meal right after a workout I sometimes make a post-workout smoothie or shake with the following ingredients. Almond Date and Hemp Energy Bars. Flex Wheeler is juiced up but if you want to include flax during the post-workout window I would take just protein immediately after the workout wait an hour and have a liquid meal with carbs and high protein including the flax. To summarize if you eat the flax seed you may not get as much protein as you would from a meat source but it may have other benefits that the meat wouldnt especially if you already do consume animal proteins at other time. I eat breakfast at about 930am then workout at about 11.</p>
