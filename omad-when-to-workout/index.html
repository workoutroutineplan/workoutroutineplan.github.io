<p>One of the biggest questions I have received recently is when do I exercise when doing one meal a day omad. This gives you time to digest and. That is the sweet spot. The most optimum time to work out on OMAD is in the late morning or early afternoon. Doing OMAD isnt necessarily dangerous for athletes and bodybuilders but it can impair performance if you dont time your meals correctly.</p>

How does it compare to eating 3 meals a day with calorie counting.</p>
