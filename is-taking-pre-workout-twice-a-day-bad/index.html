<p>The best way to think about caffeine and. Stomach Upsets Vomiting and intoxication. I only take the pre-workout during my workout days and not when im resting same with Alpha Amino but im taking this twice a day. It would just be foolish to do that because the pre workout wouldnt do anything for you.
