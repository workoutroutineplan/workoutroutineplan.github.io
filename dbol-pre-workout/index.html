Overall dbol is excellent for strength gains and breaking PRs as long as you got some base test running theres no reason you cant keep what you worked hard to get. I am currently using test and tren low dosages of both believe it or not low. Dbol has an relatively short half life as do all orals.</p>

<p>I dont love or hate dbol. But if you insist AI is necessary as DBOL aromatizes heavily. Dbol has an relatively short half life as do all orals. Dbolworks by shuttling protein directly to the muscles which you dont do pre work out. If I like how it goes pre workout I might check lol them out.</p>
