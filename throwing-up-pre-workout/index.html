<p>Kelly Chase Aaptiv trainer and Certified Holistic Health Coach explains that nausea can occur if youve eaten high-fat processed junk food or if youve eaten too soon before a workout. Why Throwing up After a Workout Is More Common Than You Might Think. It was just like this. Ive taken a few different pre-workouts in my time and every time Ive tried a new one I get nauseous. To prevent nausea be smart about when and how you fuel your body before a workout.</p>
