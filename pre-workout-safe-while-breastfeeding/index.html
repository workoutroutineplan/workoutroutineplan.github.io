<p>Pre workout supplement while breastfeeding 1. I avoid all preworkouts and supplements when breastfeeding. If youre pregnantbreastfeeding but consume caffeine regularly I say run it by your healthcare provider or your good ole intuition to decide if everything else in it is okay for your little ones. But pay attention to your babys reaction and pay attention to how your feeling. In the first 6 months you will likely be nursingpumping every 3-4 hours so there isnt really a safe time to take a pre workout.</p>
