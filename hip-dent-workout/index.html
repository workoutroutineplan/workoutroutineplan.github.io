<p>Hip dip scientifically known as trochanteric depression has less to do with the body weight and much more to do with the body structure and shape. Keeping abs engaged make small clockwise circles with left leg. Another natural and all round benefitting thing to do is thigh and glute exercises as your booty gets higher and rounder it will show from the front as a decrease in size of hip indents I have noticed this on myself and on insta famous Tammy Hembrow although she had very small hip indents to begin with but now they are non-existent on her. Any exercise that MAINLY hit the gluteus medius is best. Then as you push back up return your right leg back to the starting position.</p>
