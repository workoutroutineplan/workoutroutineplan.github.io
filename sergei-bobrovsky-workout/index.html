The Russian veteran has a 13-3-2 record with a 249 GAA and a 917 save percentage. I profiled Sergei Bobrovsky last week. The winner of the Vezina Trophy given to the top goalie in the NHL in 2013 and 2017 Bobrovsky was the first goalie in Blue Jackets history to have back-to-back 30-win.</p>

<p>Bobrovsky is the No. Bobrovsky is one of four Blue Jackets who will play for Russia in the Sochi Olympics. The Russian veteran has a 13-3-2 record with a 249 GAA and a 917 save percentage. He says after breakfast in the morning he hits the gym for a workout. A change in his training regimen led him to develop more core strength without muscle bulk in an effort to utilize his flexibility but reduce his risk of injury.</p>

<p>Bobrovsky was a disaster in his first season as the Panthers starter after signing a humongous 70-million deal. Aleksander Barkov Frank Vatrano and Mason Marchment also scored and Jonathan Huberdeau had three assists for the Panthers who improved to 17-3 at home and 14-0 overall. I profiled Sergei Bobrovsky last week. Sam Bennett scored twice and Sergei Bobrovsky made 29 saves to lead the Florida Panthers past the Montreal Canadiens 5-2 on Saturday for their third straight win.

<p>Wake up and have breakfast. Sam Bennett scored twice and Sergei Bobrovsky made 29 saves to lead the Florida Panthers past the Montreal Canadiens 5-2 on Saturday for their third straight win. Sergei Bobrovsky returned to the ice for the first time in a week and the Florida Panthers played relatively speaking cleaner in front of their goaltender than they had in the first two games of. Bobrovsky had been on the teams unfit to play list with what is believed to be COVID-19 related. The Florida Panthers had a welcomed site at practice Wednesday as star goalie Sergei Bobrovsky was on the ice for the first time since training camp opened earlier this month.</p>

<p>A year after finishing in the top 10 in Vezina Trophy voting for the third straight season Bobrovskys 900 save percentage and 323 GAA ranked 38th and 43rd respectively among 45 goalies who played at least 30 games. Bobrovsky is one of four Blue Jackets who will play for Russia in the Sochi Olympics. A noted workout fiend Bobrovsky had been plagued by groin problems until recent seasons. He swims in his pool grabs lunch rests and then hits the gym again. Bobrovsky will defend the cage against the Stars on the road Thursday.</p>
