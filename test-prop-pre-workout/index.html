<p>Since its your first cycle i believe i didnt feel like reading this whole thread i would go with 75mg a day. Ive mainly used test and winstrol suspensions in contest prep but doing it all in the AM served me fine. Because Testosterone Propionate is a slower releasing Anabolic steroid with a shorter half-life as we described above it has the capability of allowing the individual to run cycles for 8-10 weeks or even shorter sometimes as short as 6 weeks. You should see some decent results from 100mg eod as long as diet and training is good. Test suspension as a pre-workout is really over rated.</p>
