<p>Exercise and daily movement is good for our bodies on so many levels. But I also found that setting shorter term goals or deadlines within the long-term streak was a way. Consistency is arguably the most important component when working to accomplish goals in or out of the gym. Regular consistent workouts with perhaps a few little flaws who can do a perfect burpee anyway and mishaps is more beneficial to weight loss and toning than being fixated on only. Keeping a consistent workout routine helps prevent tightness in the muscles which leads to better performance.</p>
