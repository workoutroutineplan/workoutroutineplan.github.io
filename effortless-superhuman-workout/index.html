<p>This workout was designed by a collegiate track coach to build strength. Bent over row with EZ-bar 30 bent over x7. The 4-Hour Body is the result of an obsessive quest spanning more than a decade to. Ab exercises from cutting protocol. The workout that interested me most from 4HB was from the Effortless Superhuman chapter.</p>
