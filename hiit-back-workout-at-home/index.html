Once I was clear to workout I did High Intensity Interval Training HIIT about 3 times a week. Perform one of the following sprint interval workouts each workout alternating if needed. Perform ten 30-yard sprints alternating going back to start with backwards running and side shuffles.</p>

<p>Since this home workout plan is designed for women there is a bit of an emphasis on lower body workouts. Instead of requiring equipment HIIT workouts focus entirely on bodyweight exercises. High intensity interval training HIIT is one of the best ways to burn fat and maintain a healthy bodyweight. This workout was humbling for me but I know that I will come back to it on days where Im craving a quick burst of HIIT and a good brutal strength training session. I also learned to substitute my favorite bad foods with healthier alternatives.</p>

<p>Perform ten 30-yard sprints alternating going back to start with backwards running and side shuffles. Sprint 10 yards walk back to start then sprint 20 yards and walk back to start. Sprint to each 10 yard marker up to 50. Or you can come back and check for the next workout. HIIT workouts or high-intensity interval training are an effective way to exercise at home.</p>
