<p>Your body just needs a bit of rest from them. This brings us onto the next point which is eating before the session. A popular theory behind exercise-induced nausea is that a really intense workout causes all of the lactate commonly referred to as lactic acid which is a by-product of strenuous activity to pool in your muscles leaving you feeling like. Ive gotten sick from pre-workout before. I used it several years ago without any issues and have used other pre-workout mixes as well no problems.</p>

<p>I would drink plenty of water and try to rest. If I hadnt eaten that day it would pretty much always happen. Why does my pre-workout make me nauseous. HYDE contains approximately 2-3 times the amount of caffeine as most other pre workouts so only 1 scoop is needed. Sure they give awesome energy boosts tunnel visions and pumps but every time after a workout I just feel sick to my stomach like I want to throw up.</p>
