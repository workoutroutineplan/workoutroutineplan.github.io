<p>In summary dry scooping pre-workout is not only less effective than mixing it with water but also it can cause digestion problems. Dry scooping bypasses the water and allows your body to get to digesting the pre ASAP. Thats why it is advised on every pre-workout container to use recommended dose with a sufficient amount of water. Dry scooping is swallowing pre-workout supplement powder dry instead of mixing with liquid. Dry Scooping is a TikTok challenge where users put a scoop of protein or pre-workout power straight into their mouth without diluting it in water or milk.</p>
