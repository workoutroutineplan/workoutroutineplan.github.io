<p>Pre-workouts can give you that extra oomph when it comes to energy endurance and strength for your workout. As far as the physical ability to take them I believe you very much can. Glycogen is a molecule composed of many sugars all put together. Another popular additive to pre-workouts creatine should also be safe to use on a fast.

<p>Does Pre-Workout Break Your Fast And RUIN Your Results. Thats why a lot of pre-workout drinks tend to use things like beta-alanine as a performance enhancer. While it doesnt have the same benefits that caffeine does for fasting its still calorie-free and doesnt provoke an insulin response. Does it mess with the whole point of being in a fasted state. Amino Acids which are found in some pre workout supplements can cause a rise in insulin and decrease fat oxidation.</p>

<p>Ive had negative effects from taking pre workout in a fasted state. They are not used for protein creation and essentially could be consumed while fasting but they can still lead to the conversion of one of those 20 proteinogenic amino acids which will have a proteinogenic effect on the fast. One is right after a meal while the other is right before a meal. This will help your body to stay anabolic. Ive had negative effects from taking pre workout in a fasted state.</p>
