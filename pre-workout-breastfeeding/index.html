<p>I think that a lot of the push for me anyway is mental. The average standard cup of coffee 8oz contains around 95mg of caffeine and at 40mg caffeine per serving Red Leaf is a great alternative to. Also I would avoid all supplements unless your pediatrician gives the okay. It is a natural product but of course has stimulants no caffeine. Im still nursing and when I feel like I need a boost I just drink coffee right before the gym a normal amount safe for a nursing mom.</p>

Like almost all of the supplements Ive ever taken I went straight to Vitacost to see what they had available in terms of creatine glutamine protein and a preworkout supplement.

<p>Whether or not you can safely take your pre-workout supplements will depend on what ingredients they contain. Keep breast feeding for at least 24 months. Studies have shown no difference in milk production or nutrient composition or babies weight gain. With such a mild dose of caffeine many of our customers continue using it throughout the duration of their pregnancy. I was super active prior to pregnancy and using pre-workout and BCAAs regularly moderately-mildly active during using black coffee as a helpful boost and Im working on getting into a regular fitness routine once again.</p>
