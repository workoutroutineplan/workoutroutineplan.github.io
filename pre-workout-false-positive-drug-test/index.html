<p>Avoid pre-workouts that make medical claims. Can workout supplements show false positives in a drug test screening. However this is where the subject gets murky. I asked what could of caused it and they said it was a chemical found in several pre-workout supplements. MOST positive drug test results for meth are indeed positive for methamphetamine.</p>

<p>To safeguard against false positives drug testing labs re-test specimens that return positive panel-tests to rule out the possibility of a false positive. Additional information obtained from an immunoassay vendor suggested the anorectic compound dimethylamylamine DMAA may be the cause of the false-positive screens. You knew you were breaking the rules. Pre workout that is test-safe. Drug Monitoring and False Positives.</p>

<p>Yes that is possible if you are taking a supplement from an unreliable source. For pre and current employment law enforcement armed forces etc they do not have the ability to show as a false positive or positively cause anyone to fail for an illegal stimulant regarding a Urinalysis. Yes that is possible if you are taking a supplement from an unreliable source. I believe it is the 13 dimeth that causes the false positive. There is a very real possibility that DMHA in your system may cause a false positive result.</p>

<p>An additional 134 false-positive samples were received and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS-MS for DMAA. Urine drug screenings are useful diagnostic tests. In chronic pain management drug testing can assess the appropriate intake of drugs help with the diagnosis of substance abuse and improve drug management. There is a very real possibility that DMHA in your system may cause a false positive result. We wouldnt even consider a Public Safety program if there was a chance.</p>
