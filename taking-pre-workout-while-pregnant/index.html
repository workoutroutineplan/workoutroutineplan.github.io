<p>Before taking any pre-workout supplements during pregnancy you have to find out the ingredients they contain. Many pre-workout supplements come with caffeine. If you have concerns please consult a physician. I use MRMs Bone Maximizer. When it comes to healthy caffeine options to consider for pregnancy we encourage you to try Red Leaf Pre-Workout Energizer.</p>

<p>I did not take pre-workout during pregnancy. These pregnancy workouts are a great place to start. This Pre-Workout has a lot going for it. And do not use if pregnant or nursing. If you were training with weights before you were pregnant its generally safe to continue while.</p>
