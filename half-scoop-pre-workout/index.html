Mix 1 scoop in 6-8 fluid ounces of cold water milk or beverage of choice. As a dietary supplement mix 1 heaping scoop of PRE into 12-14 ounces of water and consume 30-45 minutes prior to resistance training. Start with 1 scoop half-thavage if needed work your way up to 2 scoops full thavage.</p>

Check out Vintage Blast the first ever two-stage pre workout from Old School Labs and see how it can help you get stronger. This is another product I wanted to be head and shoulders clear as day superior to everything else in the industry.</p>
